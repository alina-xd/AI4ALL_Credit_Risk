# Welcome!

This is a group project created by Alina Du, Natasha Borda, Mildred Nwachukwu-Innocent, and Tanesha Fuller as a part of an AI4ALL cohort. Under the finance category, we have chosen to focus on the topic of Credit Risk with the goal of enhancing predictions using Artificial Intelligence. 

## Overview: What is Credit Risk?

Credit Risk refers to the probability of default. In the context of finance and banking, defaulting is defined as a borrower’s failure to repay money they owe. Banks and lenders use models to predict the likelihood of default, which ultimately determines who is eligible for loans or credit.

## Importance

This project is significant because within the United States, these credit risk models impact people’s access to housing, education, and business opportunities. If these models are biased, they can unfairly exclude qualified candidates--especially those from historically marginalized communities.

## Research Question

How can we design an AI model that predicts credit risk fairly and accurately, while identifying and reducing bias against low-income and underserved borrowers?


## Models Trained

- **Logistic Regression**
- **Random Forest**
- **XGBoost**

## Evaluation Metrics

Given the class imbalance, traditional accuracy is misleading. Instead, we are focusing on:

- **Precision**
- **Recall**
- **F1 Score**
